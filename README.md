# Optimize Your Experience with Containers. Make Your Containers Better, Smaller, More Secure and Do Less to Get There (free and open source!)

Note that **DockerSlim** is now just **Slim** (**SlimToolkit** is the full name, so it's easier to find it online) to show its growing support for additional container tools and runtimes in the cloud native ecosystem.

**Slim** is now a CNCF Sandbox project. It was created by [Kyle](https://github.com/kcq) [Quest](https://twitter.com/kcqon) and it's been improved by many [contributors](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/graphs/contributors). The project is supported by [Slim.AI](https://slim.ai).

## Overview

Slim allows developers to inspect, optimize and debug their containers using its `xray`, `lint`, `build`, `debug` (and other) commands. It simplifies and improves your developer experience building, customizing and using containers. It makes your containers better, smaller and more secure while providing advanced visibility and improved usability working with the original and minified containers.

Don't change anything in your container image and minify it by up to 30x making it secure too! Optimizing images isn't the only thing it can do though. It can also help you understand and author better container images.

Keep doing what you are doing. No need to change anything. Use the base image you want. Use the package manager you want. Don't worry about hand optimizing your Dockerfile. You shouldn't have to throw away your tools and your workflow to have small container images.

Don't worry about manually creating Seccomp and AppArmor security profiles. You shouldn't have to become an expert in Linux syscalls, Seccomp and AppArmor to have secure containers. Even if you do know enough about it wasting time reverse engineering your application behavior can be time-consuming.

Slim will optimize and secure your containers by understanding your application and what it needs using various analysis techniques. It will throw away what you don't need, reducing the attack surface of your container. What if you need some of those extra things to debug your container? You can use dedicated debugging side-car containers for that (more details below).

Understand your container image before and after you optimize it using the `xray` command in the `slim` app or the [**Slim.AI SaaS**](https://portal.slim.dev/login?invitecode=invite.1s85zlfnYX0p5TT1XKja49pAHbL) where you can get even more powerful insights including how your container image changed.

Slim has been used with Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Rust, Elixir and PHP (some app types) running on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Alpine and even Distroless.

Note that some application stacks do require advanced container probing to make sure that all dynamically loaded components are detected. See the `--http-probe*` flags for more details to know how you can define custom probe commands. In some cases you might also need to use the `--include-path` flag to make sure everything your application needs is included (e.g., `ubuntu.com` python SPA app container image [example](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples/tree/master/3rdparty/ubuntu-com) where the client side template files are explicitly included).

It's also a good idea to use your app/environment tests when you run the Slim app. See the `--continue-after` flag for more details about integrating your tests with the temporary container Slim creates when it's doing its dynamic analysis. Running tests in the target container is also an option, but it does require you to specify a custom ENTRYPOINT/CMD with a custom wrapper to start your app and to execute your tests.

Interactive CLI prompt screencast:

[![asciicast](assets/images/dslim/DockerSlimIntPromptDemo.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/311513)

Watch this screencast to see how an application image is minified by more than 30x.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/rHqW8cbr3vXe0WxorHsD36n7V.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/rHqW8cbr3vXe0WxorHsD36n7V)

When you run the `build` or `profile` commands in Slim it gives you an opportunity to interact with the temporary container it creates. By default, it will pause and wait for your input before it continues its execution. You can change this behavior using the `--continue-after` flag.

If your application exposes any web interfaces (e.g., when you have a web server or an HTTP API), you'll see the port numbers on the host machine you will need to use to interact with your application (look for the `port.list` and `target.port.info` messages on the screen). For example, in the screencast above you'll see that the internal application port 8000 is mapped to port 32911 on your host.

Note that Slim will interact with your application for you when HTTP probing is enabled (enabled by default; see the `--http-probe*` flag docs for more details). Some web applications built with scripting languages like Python or Ruby require service interactions to load everything in the application. Enable HTTP probing unless it gets in your way.

You can also interact with the temporary container via a shell script or snippet using `--exec-file` or `--exec`. For example, you can create a container which is only capable of using curl.

```bash
>> docker pull archlinux:latest
...

>> slim build --target archlinux:latest --tag archlinux:curl --http-probe=false --exec "curl checkip.amazonaws.com"
...

>> docker run archlinux:curl curl checkip.amazonaws.com
...

>> docker images
archlinux                 curl                ...        ...         17.4MB
archlinux                 latest              ...        ...         467MB
...
```

mv  dist_mac/docker-slim-sensor /usr/local/bin/
```

3. Add the location where you unzipped the package to your PATH environment variable (optional).

If the directory where you extracted the binaries is not in your PATH then you'll need to run your Slim app binary from that directory.

#### Scripted Install

You can also use this script to install the current release of Slim on Linux (x86 and ARM) and macOS (x86 and Apple Silicon)

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slimtoolkit/slim/master/scripts/install-slim.sh | sudo -E bash -
```

### Homebrew

```
brew install docker-slim
```

The Homebrew installer: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/docker-slim

### Docker

```
docker pull dslim/slim
```

See the [RUNNING CONTAINERIZED](#running-containerized) section for more usage info.

### SaaS

Powered by Slim. It will help you understand and troubleshoot your application containers and a lot more. If you use the `xray` command you'll want to try the SaaS. Understanding image changes is easy with its container diff capabilities. Connect your own registry and you can do the same with your own containers. Try it [here](https://portal.slim.dev/login?invitecode=invite.1s85zlfnYX0p5TT1XKja49pAHbL) without installing anything locally.


## BASIC USAGE INFO

`slim [global flags] [lint|xray|build|profile|update|version|help] [command-specific flags] <IMAGE_ID_OR_NAME>`

If you don't specify any command `slim` will start in the interactive prompt mode.

### COMMANDS

- `xray` - Performs static analysis for the target container image (including 'reverse engineering' the Dockerfile for the image). Use this command if you want to know what's inside of your container image and what makes it fat.
- `lint` - Analyzes container instructions in Dockerfiles (Docker image support is WIP)
- `build` - Analyzes, profiles and optimizes your container image generating the supported security profiles. This is the most popular command.
- `registry` - Execute registry operations.
- `profile` - Performs basic container image analysis and dynamic container analysis, but it doesn't generate an optimized image.
- `run` - Runs one or more containers (for now runs a single container similar to `docker run`)
- `version` - Shows the version information.
- `update` - Updates Slim to the latest version.
- `help` - Show the available commands and global flags

Example: `slim build my/sample-app`

See the `USAGE DETAILS` section for more details. Run `slim help` to get a high level overview of the available commands. Run `slim COMMAND_NAME` without any parameters and you'll get more information about that command (e.g., `slim build`).

If you run `slim` without any parameters you'll get an interactive prompt that will provide suggestions about the available commands and flags. `Tabs` are used to show the available options, to autocomplete the parameters and to navigate the option menu (which you can also do with Up and Down arrows). `Spaces` are used to move to the next parameter and `Enter` is used to run the command. For more info about the interactive prompt see [`go-prompt`](https://github.com/c-bata/go-prompt).

## USAGE DETAILS

`slim [global options] command [command options] <target image ID or name>`

Commands:

- `xray` - Show what's in the container image and reverse engineer its Dockerfile
- `lint` - Lint the target Dockerfile (or image, in the future)
- `build` - Analyze the target container image along with its application and build an optimized image from it
- `registry` - Execute registry operations.
- `profile` - Collect fat image information and generate a fat container report
- `version` - Show app and docker version information
- `update` - Update the app
- `help` - Show help info

Global options:

- `--report` - command report location (target location where to save the executed command results; `slim.report.json` by default; set it to `off` to disable)
- `--check-version` - check if the current version is outdated
- `--version` - print the version
- `--debug` - enable debug logs
- `--verbose` - enable info logs
- `--log-level` - set the logging level ('debug', 'info', 'warn' (default), 'error', 'fatal', 'panic')
- `--log-format` - set the format used by logs ('text' (default), or 'json')
- `--console-format` - set the console output format to use ('text' (default), or 'json')

- `--in-container` - Set it to true to explicitly indicate that Slim is running in a container (if it's not set Slim will try to analyze the environment where it's running to determine if it's containerized)

To disable the version checks set the global `--check-version` flag to `false` (e.g., `--check-version=false`) or you can use the `DSLIM_CHECK_VERSION` environment variable.

In the interactive CLI prompt mode you must specify the target image using the `--target` flag while in the traditional CLI mode you can use the `--target` flag or you can specify the target image as the last value in the command.

The `--include-path` option is useful if you want to customize your minified image adding extra files and directories. The `--include-path-file` option allows you to load multiple includes from a newline delimited file. Use this option if you have a lot of includes. The includes from `--include-path` and `--include-path-file` are combined together. You can also use the `--exclude-pattern` flag to control what shouldn't be included.

The `--continue-after` option is useful if you need to script the Slim app. If you pick the `probe` option then Slim will continue executing the build command after the HTTP probe is done executing. If you pick the `exec` options then Slim will continue executing the build command after the container exec shell commands (specified using the `--exec-file` or `--exec` flags) are done executing. If you pick the `timeout` option Slim will allow the target container to run for 60 seconds before it will attempt to collect the artifacts. You can specify a custom timeout value by passing a number of seconds you need instead of the `timeout` string. If you pick the `signal` option you'll need to send a `USR1` signal to the Slim app process. The `signal` option is useful when you want to run your own tests against the temporary container Slim creates. Your test automation / CI/CD pipeline will be able to notify the Slim app that it's done running its test by sending the `USR1` to it.

You can also combine multiple `continue-after` modes. For now only combining `probe` and `exec` is supported (using either `probe&exec` or `exec&probe` as the `--continue-after` flag value). Other combinations may work too. Combining `probe` and `signal` is not supported.

The `--include-shell` option provides a simple way to keep a basic shell in the minified container. Not all shell commands are included. To get additional shell commands or other command line utilities use the `--include-exe` and/or `--include-bin` options. Note that the extra apps and binaries might missed some of the non-binary dependencies (which don't get picked up during static analysis). For those additional dependencies use the `--include-path` and `--include-path-file` options.

The `--dockerfile` option makes it possible to build a new minified image directly from source Dockerfile. Pass the Dockerfile name as the value for this flag and pass the build context directory or URL instead of the docker image name as the last parameter for the `build` command: `slim build --dockerfile Dockerfile --tag my/custom_minified_image_name .` If you want to see the console output from the build stages (when the fat and slim images are built) add the `--show-blogs` build flag. Note that the build console output is not interactive and it's printed only after the corresponding build step is done. The fat image created during the build process has the `.fat` suffix in its name. If you specify a custom image tag (with the `--tag` flag) the `.fat` suffix is added to the name part of the tag. If you don't provide a custom tag the generated fat image name will have the following format: `slim-tmp-fat-image.<pid_of_slim>.<current_timestamp>`. The minified image name will have the `.slim` suffix added to that auto-generated container image name (`slim-tmp-fat-image.<pid_of_slim>.<current_timestamp>.slim`). Take a look at this [python examples](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples/tree/master/python_ubuntu_18_py27_from_dockerfile) to see how it's using the `--dockerfile` flag.

The `--use-local-mounts` option is used to choose how the Slim sensor is added to the target container and how the sensor artifacts are delivered back to the master. If you enable this option you'll get the original Slim app behavior where it uses local file system volume mounts to add the sensor executable and to extract the artifacts from the target container. This option doesn't always work as expected in the dockerized environment where Slim itself is running in a Docker container. When this option is disabled (default behavior) then a separate Docker volume is used to mount the sensor and the sensor artifacts are explicitly copied from the target container.

### `REGISTRY` COMMAND OPTIONS

#### `PULL` SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS

USAGE: `slim registry pull [IMAGE]`

- `--target value` - Target container image (name or ID) [$DSLIM_TARGET]
- `--save-to-docker`- Save pulled image to docker (default: true) [$DSLIM_REG_PULL_SAVE_TO_DOCKER]

USAGE: `slim registry push [IMAGE]`

#### `COPY` SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS

USAGE: `slim registry copy [SRC_IMAGE] [DST_IMAGE]`

## RUNNING CONTAINERIZED

The current version of Slim is able to run in containers. It will try to detect if it's running in a containerized environment, but you can also tell Slim explicitly using the `--in-container` global flag.

You can run Slim in your container directly or you can use the Slim container image in your containerized environment. If you are using the Slim container image make sure you run it configured with the Docker IPC information, so it can communicate with the Docker daemon. The most common way to do it is by mounting the Docker unix socket to the Slim app container. Some containerized environments (like Gitlab and their `dind` service) might not expose the Docker unix socket to you, so you'll need to make sure the environment variables used to communicate with Docker (e.g., `DOCKER_HOST`) are passed to the Slim app container. Note that if those environment variables reference any kind of local host names those names need to be replaced or you need to tell the Slim app about them using the `--etc-hosts-map` flag. If those environment variables reference local files those local files (e.g., files for TLS cert validation) will need to be copied to a temporary container, so that temporary container can be used as a data container to make those files accessible by the Slim app container.

When Slim app runs in a container it will attempt to save its execution state in a separate Docker volume. If the volume doesn't exist it will try to create it (`slim-state`, by default). You can pick a different state volume or disable this behavior completely by using the global `--archive-state` flag. If you do want to persist the Slim app execution state (which includes the `seccomp` and `AppArmor` profiles) without using the state archiving feature you can mount your own volume that maps to the `/bin/.slim-state` directory in the Slim app container.

By default, the Slim app will try to create a Docker volume for its sensor unless one already exists. If this behavior is not supported by your containerized environment you can create a volume separately and pass its name to the Slim app using the `--use-sensor-volume` flag.

Here's a basic example of how to use the containerized version of the Slim app:
`docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock dslim/slim build your-docker-image-name`

Here's a GitLab example for their `dind` `.gitlab-ci.yml` config file:
`docker run -e DOCKER_HOST=tcp://$(grep docker /etc/hosts | cut -f1):2375 dslim/slim build your-docker-image-name`

Here's a CircleCI example for their `remote docker` `.circleci/config.yml` config file (used after the `setup_remote_docker` step):

```bash
docker create -v /dcert_path --name dcert alpine:latest /bin/true
docker cp $DOCKER_CERT_PATH/. dcert:/dcert_path
docker run --volumes-from dcert -e DOCKER_HOST=$DOCKER_HOST -e DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=$DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY -e DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/dcert_path dslim/slim build your-docker-image-name
```

## DOCKER CONNECT OPTIONS

If you don't specify any Docker connect options the Slim app expects to find the Docker Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) or the following environment variables: `DOCKER_HOST`, `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` (optional), `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` (required if `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` is set to `"1"`). Note that the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable can be used to point to a Unix socket address (in case the default Unix socket isn't there). This is useful when you use Docker Desktop and you haven't configured Docker Desktop to create the default Unix socket.

If the Docker environment variables are configured to use TLS and to verify the Docker cert (default behavior), but you want to disable the TLS verification you can override the TLS verification behavior by setting the `--tls-verify` to false:

`slim --tls-verify=false build my/sample-node-app-multi`

You can override all Docker connection options using these flags: `--host`, `--tls`, `--tls-verify`, `--tls-cert-path`. These flags correspond to the standard Docker options (and the environment variables). Note that you can also use the `--host` flag (similar to `DOCKER_HOST`) to point to a Unix socket (e.g., `--host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock`).

If you want to use TLS with verification:

`slim --host=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376 --tls-cert-path=/Users/youruser/.docker/machine/machines/default --tls=true --tls-verify=true build my/sample-node-app-multi`

If you want to use TLS without verification:

`slim --host=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376 --tls-cert-path=/Users/youruser/.docker/machine/machines/default --tls=true --tls-verify=false build my/sample-node-app-multi`

If the Docker environment variables are not set and if you don't specify any Docker connect options Slim will try to use the default unix socket.

### DOCKER DESKTOP

You may not have the default Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) configured if you use Docker Desktop. By default, Docker Desktop uses `~/.docker/run/docker.sock` as the Unix socket.

You can either use `--host` or `DOCKER_HOST` to point to the Docker Desktop's Unix socket or you can configure Docker Desktop to create the default/traditional Unix socket (creating the `/var/run/docker.sock` symlink manually is an option too).

To configure Docker Desktop to create the default Unix socket open its UI and go to `Settings -> Advanced` where you need to check the `Enable default Docker socket (Requires password)` option.

## HTTP PROBE COMMANDS

If the HTTP probe is enabled (note: it is enabled by default) it will default to running `GET /` with HTTP and then HTTPS on every exposed port. You can add additional commands using the `--http-probe-cmd` and `--http-probe-cmd-file` options.

If you want to disable HTTP probing set the `--http-probe` flag to false (e.g., `--http-probe=false`). You can also use the `--http-probe-off` flag to do the same (simply use the flag without any parameters).

The `--http-probe-cmd` option is good when you want to specify a small number of simple commands where you select some or all of these HTTP command options: crawling (defaults to false), protocol, method (defaults to GET), resource (path and query string).

If you only want to use custom HTTP probe command and you don't want the default `GET /` command added to the command list you explicitly provided you'll need to set `--http-probe` to false when you specify your custom HTTP probe command. Note that this inconsistency will be addressed in the future releases to make it less confusing.

Possible field combinations:
* `/path` - runs `GET /path`
* `crawl:/path` - runs `GET /path` and then crawls the pages referenced by the target page
* `post:/path` - runs `POST /path`
* `crawl:get:/path` - runs `GET /path` and then crawls the pages referenced by the target page
* `https:get:/path` runs `GET /path` only on https
* `crawl:http:get:/path` - runs `GET /path` and then crawls the pages referenced by the target page

Here are a couple of examples:

Adds two extra probe commands: `GET /api/info` and `POST /submit` (tries http first, then tries https):
`slim build --show-clogs --http-probe-cmd /api/info --http-probe-cmd POST:/submit my/sample-node-app-multi`

Adds one extra probe command: `POST /submit` (using only http):
`slim build --show-clogs --http-probe-cmd http:POST:/submit my/sample-node-app-multi`

The `--http-probe-cmd-file` option is good when you have a lot of commands and/or you want to select additional HTTP command options.

Available HTTP command options:
* `method` - HTTP method to use
* `resource` - target resource URL
* `port` - port number
* `protocol` - `http`, `https`, `http2`, `http2c` (cleartext version of http2), `ws`, `wss` (secure websocket)
* `headers` - array of strings with column delimited key/value pairs (e.g., "Content-Type: application/json")
* `body` - request body as a string
* `body_file` - request body loaded from the provided file
* `username` - username to use for basic auth
* `password` - password to use for basic auth
* `crawl` - boolean to indicate if you want to crawl the target (to visit all referenced resources)

Here's a probe command file example:

`slim build --show-clogs --http-probe-cmd-file probeCmds.json my/sample-node-app-multi`

Commands in `probeCmds.json`:

```
{
  "commands":
  [
   {
     "resource": "/api/info"
   },
   {
     "method": "POST",
     "resource": "/submit"
   },
   {
     "procotol": "http",
     "resource": "/api/call?arg=one"
   },
   {
     "protocol": "http",
     "method": "POST",
     "resource": "/submit2",
     "body": "key=value"
   },
   {
     "protocol": "http",
     "method": "POST",
     "resource": "/submit3",
     "body_file": "mydata.json",
     "headers": ["Content-Type: application/json"]
   }
  ]
}
```

The HTTP probe command file path can be a relative path (relative to the current working directory) or it can be an absolute path.

For each HTTP probe call Slim will print the call status. Example: `info=http.probe.call status=200 method=GET target=http://127.0.0.1:32899/ attempt=1 error=none`.

You can execute your own external HTTP requests using the `target.port.list` field in the container info message Slim prints when it starts its test container: `slim[build]: info=container name=<your_container_name> id=<your_container_id> target.port.list=[<comma_separated_list_of_port_numbers_to_use>] target.port.info=[<comma_separated_list_of_port_mapping_records>]`. Example: `slim[build]: info=container name=slimk_42861_20190203084955 id=aa44c43bcf4dd0dae78e2a8b3ac011e7beb6f098a65b09c8bce4a91dc2ff8427 target.port.list=[32899] target.port.info=[9000/tcp => 0.0.0.0:32899]`. With this information you can run `curl` or other HTTP request generating tools: `curl http://localhost:32899`.

The current version also includes an experimental `crawling` capability. To enable it for the default HTTP probe use the `--http-probe-crawl` flag. You can also enable it for the HTTP probe commands in your command file using the `crawl` boolean field.

When `crawling` is enabled the HTTP probe will act like a web crawler following the links it finds in the target endpoint.

Probing based on the Swagger/OpenAPI spec is another experimental capability. This feature introduces two new flags:
* `http-probe-apispec` - value: `<path_to_fetch_spec>:<api_endpoint_prefix>`
* `http-probe-apispec-file` - value: `<local_file_path_to_spec>`

You can use the `--http-probe-exec` and `--http-probe-exec-file` options to run the user provided commands when the http probes are executed. This example shows how you can run `curl` against the temporary container created by Slim when the http probes are executed.

`slim build --http-probe-exec 'curl http://localhost:YOUR_CONTAINER_PORT_NUM/some/path' --publish-port YOUR_CONTAINER_PORT_NUM your-container-image-name`


## DEBUGGING MINIFIED CONTAINERS

You can create dedicated debugging side-car container images loaded with the tools you need for debugging target containers. This allows you to keep your production container images small. The debugging side-car containers attach to the running target containers.

Assuming you have a running container named `node_app_alpine` you can attach your debugging side-car with a command like this: `docker run --rm -it --pid=container:node_app_alpine --net=container:node_app_alpine --cap-add sys_admin alpine sh`. In this example, the debugging side-car is a regular alpine image. This is exactly what happens with the `node_alpine` app sample (located in the `node_alpine` directory of the `examples` repo) and the `run_debug_sidecar.command` helper script.

If you run the `ps` command in the side-car you'll see the application from the target container:

```
# ps
PID   USER     TIME   COMMAND
    1 root       0:00 node /opt/my/service/server.js
   13 root       0:00 sh
   38 root       0:00 ps
```

You can access the target container file system through `/proc/<TARGET_PID>/root`:

```
# ls -lh /proc/1/root/opt/my/service
total 8
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root        4.0K Sep  2 15:51 node_modules
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         415 Sep  8 00:52 server.js
```

Some of the useful debugging commands include `cat /proc/<TARGET_PID>/cmdline`, `ls -l /proc/<TARGET_PID>/cwd`, `cat /proc/1/environ`, `cat /proc/<TARGET_PID>/limits`, `cat /proc/<TARGET_PID>/status` and `ls -l /proc/<TARGET_PID>/fd`.

## MINIFYING COMMAND LINE TOOLS

Unless the default CMD instruction in your Dockerfile is sufficient you'll have to specify command line parameters when you execute the `build` command in Slim. This can be done with the `--cmd` option.

Other useful command line parameters:

- `--show-clogs` - use it if you want to see the output of your container.
- `--mount` - use it to mount a volume when Slim inspects your image.
- `--entrypoint` - use it if you want to override the ENTRYPOINT instruction when Slim inspects your image.

Note that the `--entrypoint` and `--cmd` options don't override the `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` instructions in the final minified image.

Here's a sample `build` command:

`slim build --show-clogs=true --cmd docker-compose.yml --mount $(pwd)/data/:/data/ dslim/container-transform`

It's used to minify the `container-transform` tool. You can get the minified image from [`Docker Hub`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dslim/container-transform.slim/).

## QUICK SECCOMP EXAMPLE

If you want to auto-generate a Seccomp profile AND minify your image use the `build` command. If you only want to auto-generate a Seccomp profile (along with other interesting image metadata) use the `profile` command.

Step one: run Slim

`slim build your-name/your-app`

Step two: use the generated Seccomp profile

`docker run --security-opt seccomp:<slim directory>/.images/<YOUR_APP_IMAGE_ID>/artifacts/your-name-your-app-seccomp.json <your other run params> your-name/your-app`

Feel free to copy the generated profile :-)

You can use the generated Seccomp profile with your original image or with the minified image.

## USING AUTO-GENERATED SECCOMP PROFILES

You can use the generated profile with your original image or with the minified image Slim created:

`docker run -it --rm --security-opt seccomp:path_to/my-sample-node-app-seccomp.json -p 8000:8000 my/sample-node-app.slim`

## DEMO STEPS

The demo runs on Mac OS X, but you can build a linux version. Note that these steps are different from the steps in the demo video.

1. Get the Slim app binaries:

* [Mac](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.2/dist_mac.zip),
* [Mac M1](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.2/dist_mac_m1.zip), 
* [Linux](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.2/dist_linux.tar.gz), 
* [Linux ARM](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.2/dist_linux_arm.tar.gz),
* [Linux ARM64](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.2/dist_linux_arm64.tar.gz) 

Unzip them and optionally add their directory to your `PATH` environment variable if you want to use the app from other locations.

The extracted directory contains two binaries (and now it also contains a symlink for the old name):

- `slim` <- the main Slim application binary
- `slim-sensor` <- the sensor application used to collect information from running containers
- `docker-slim` <- the symlink to `slim`, the new main app binary (useful if you are still using the old name in your scripts)

2. Clone the `examples` repo to use the sample apps (note: the examples have been moved to a separate repo). You can skip this step if you have your own app.

`git clone https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples.git`

3. Create a Docker image for the sample node.js app in `examples/node_ubuntu`. You can skip this step if you have your own app.

`cd examples/node_ubuntu`

`docker build -t my/sample-node-app .`

4. Run the Slim app:

`./slim build my/sample-node-app` <- run it from the location where you extraced the Slim app binaries (or update your `PATH` env var to include the directory where the Slim app binaries are located)

Slim creates a special container based on the target image you provided. It also creates a resource directory where it stores the information it discovers about your image: `<slim directory>/.images/<TARGET_IMAGE_ID>`.

By default, the Slim app will run its http probe against the temporary container. If you are minifying a command line tool that doesn't expose any web service interface you'll need to explicitly disable http probing (by setting `--http-probe=false`).

5. Use curl (or other tools) to call the sample app (optional)

`curl http://<YOUR_DOCKER_HOST_IP>:<PORT>`

This is an optional step to make sure the target app container is doing something. Depending on the application it's an optional step. For some applications it's required if it loads new application resources dynamically based on the requests it's processing (e.g., Ruby or Python).

You'll see the mapped ports printed to the console when the Slim app starts the target container. You can also get the port number either from the `docker ps` or `docker port <CONTAINER_ID>` commands. The current version of DockerSlim doesn't allow you to map exposed network ports (it works like `docker run … -P`).

6. Press <enter> and wait until the Slim app says it's done

By default or when http probing is enabled explicitly the Slim app will continue its execution once the http probe is done running. If you explicitly picked a different `continue-after` option follow the expected steps. For example, for the `enter` `continue-after` option you must press the `enter` button on your keyboard.

If http probing is enabled (when `http-probe` is set) and if `continue-after` is set to `enter` and you press the `enter` key before the built-in HTTP probe is done the probe might produce an EOF error because the Slim app will shut down the target container before all probe commands are done executing. It's ok to ignore it unless you really need the probe to finish.

7. Once Slim is done check that the new minified image is there

`docker images`

You should see `my/sample-node-app.slim` in the list of images. Right now all generated images have `.slim` at the end of its name.

8. Use the minified image

`docker run -it --rm --name="slim_node_app" -p 8000:8000 my/sample-node-app.slim`

## FAQ

### Is it safe for production use?

Yes! Either way, you should test your Docker images.

### How can I contribute if I don't know Go?

You don't need to read the language spec and lots of books :-) Go through the [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) and optionally read [50 Shades of Go](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/) and you'll be ready to contribute!

### What's the best application for Slim?

Slim will work for any containerized application; however, Slim automates app interactions for applications with an HTTP API. You can use Slim even if your app doesn't have an HTTP API. You'll need to interact with your application manually to make sure Slim can observe your application behavior.

### Can I use Slim with dockerized command line tools?

Yes. The `--cmd`, `--entrypoint`, and `--mount` options will help you minify your image. The `container-transform` tool is a good example.

Notes:

You can explore the artifacts Slim generates when it's creating a slim image. You'll find those in `<slim directory>/.images/<TARGET_IMAGE_ID>/artifacts`. One of the artifacts is a "reverse engineered" Dockerfile for the original image. It'll be called `Dockerfile.fat`.

If you'd like to see the artifacts without running the Slim app you can take a look at the `examples/artifacts` directory in this repo. It doesn't include any image files, but you'll find:

- a reverse engineered Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.fat`)
- a container report file (`creport.json`)
- a sample AppArmor profile (which will be named based on your original image name)
- and a sample Seccomp profile

If you don't want to create a minified image and only want to "reverse engineer" the Dockerfile you can use the `info` command.

### What if my Docker images uses the USER command?

The current version of Slim does include support for non-default users (take a look at the non-default user examples (including the ElasticSearch example located in the `3rdparty` directory) in the [`examples`](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples) repo. Please open tickets if something doesn't work for you.

Everything should work as-is, but for the special cases where the current behavior don't work as expected you can adjust what Slim does using various `build` command parameters: `--run-target-as-user`, `--keep-perms`, `--path-perms`, `--path-perms-file` (along with the `--include-*` parameters).

The `--run-target-as-user` parameter is enabled by default and it controls if the application in the temporary container is started using the identity from the USER instruction in the container's Dockerfile.

The `--keep-perms` parameter is also enabled by default. It tells Slim to retain the permissions and the ownership information for the files and directories copied to the optimized container image.

The `--path-perms` and `--path-perms-file` parameters are similar to the `--include-path` and `--include-path-file` parameters. They are used to overwrite the permission and the user/group information for the target files and directories. Note that the target files/directories are expected to be in the optimized container image. If you don't know if the target files/directories will be in the optimized container you'll need to use one of the `--include-*` parameters (e.g., `--include-path-file`) to explicitly require those artifacts to be included. You can specify the permissions and the ownership information in the `--include-*` parameters too (so you don't need to have the `--path-*` parameters just to set the permissions).

The `--path-*` and `--include-*` params use the same format to communicate the permission/owernship info: `TARGET_PATH_OR_NAME:PERMS_IN_OCTAL_FORMAT#USER_ID#GROUP_ID`.

You don't have to specify the user and group IDs if you don't want to change them.

Here's an example using these parameters to minify the standard `nginx` image adding extra artifacts and changing their permissions: `slim build --include-path='/opt:770#104#107' --include-path='/bin/uname:710' --path-perms='/tmp:700' nginx`.

This is what you'll see in the optimized container image:

```
drwx------  0 0      0           0 Feb 28 22:15 tmp/
-rwx--x---  0 0      0       31240 Mar 14  2015 bin/uname
drwxrwx---  0 104    107         0 Feb 28 22:13 opt/
```

The `uname` binary isn't used by nginx, so the `--include-path` parameter is used to keep it in the optimized image changing its permissions to `710`.

The `/tmp` directory will be included in the optimized image on its own, so the `--path-perms` parameter is used to change its permissions to `700`.

When you set permissions/user/group on a directory the settings are only applied to that directory and not to the artifacts inside. The future versions will allow you to apply the same settings to everything inside the target directory too.

Also note that for now you have to use numeric user and group IDs. The future versions will allow you to use user and group names too.

### Nginx fails in my minified image

If you see `nginx: [emerg] mkdir() "/var/lib/nginx/body" failed` it means your nginx setup uses a non-standard temporary directory. Nginx will fail if the base directory for its temporary folders doesn't exist (they won't create the missing intermediate directories). Normally it's `/var/lib/nginx`, but if you have a custom config that points to something else you'll need to add an `--include-path` flag as an extra flag when you run the Slim app.

### Slim fails with a 'no permission to read from' error

This problem shouldn't happen anymore because the exported artifacts are saved in a tar file and the master app doesn't need to access the files directly anymore.

If you run older versions of Slim you can get around this problem by running Slim from a root shell. That way it will have access to all exported files.

Slim copies the relevant image artifacts trying to preserve their permissions. If the permissions are too restrictive the master app might not have sufficient priviledge to access these files when it's building the new minified image.

## BUILD PROCESS

#### Build Options

Pick one of the build options that works best for you.

##### Containerized

Run `make build_in_docker` on linux or `make build_m1_in_docker` on Macs (or `./scripts/docker-builder.run.sh` or click on `./scripts/mac/docker-builder.run.command` on Macs) from the project directory (builds Slim in a Docker container; great if you don't want to install Go on your local machine and if you already have Docker).

##### Native

Run `make build` on linux or `make build_m1` on Macs (or `./scripts/src.build.sh` or click on `./scripts/mac/src.build.command` on Macs) to build Slim natively (requires Go installed locally).

Note:

Try using the latest version of Go building the Slim app. The current version of Go used to build the Slim app is 1.19.

##### Gitpod

If you have a web browser, you can get a fully pre-configured development environment in one click:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim)


##### Additional Tools

- `license-bill-of-materials` - Optional tool to track dependencies and their licenses.
- `golint` - Optional tool for code analysis. See `https://github.com/golang/lint` for more details.

You can install these tools using the `tools.get.sh` shell script in the `scripts` directory.

Notes:

- Make sure you have `golint` if you intend to run the `src.inspect.sh` or `mac.src.inspect.command` scripts.

## CONTRIBUTING

If the project sounds interesting or if you found a bug see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit a PR!

## DESIGN

To learn more about the code take a look at this [interactive code diagram](https://app.codesee.io/maps/public/1cedd540-6451-11ec-a279-0572ca5abbdc) generated using [CodeSee](https://www.codesee.io) and watch the `Slim Code` videos on ['YouTube'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy7RHjJlaBhpCCbChrd8POA?sub_confirmation=1).

### CORE CONCEPTS

1. Inspect container metadata (static analysis)
2. Inspect container data (static analysis)
3. Inspect running application (dynamic analysis)
4. Build an application artifact graph
5. Use the collected application data to build small images
6. Use the collected application data to auto-generate various security framework configurations.

### DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OPTIONS

1. Instrument the container image (and replace the entrypoint/cmd) to collect application activity data
2. Use kernel-level tools that provide visibility into running containers (without instrumenting the containers)
3. Disable relevant namespaces in the target container to gain container visibility (can be done with runC)

### SECURITY

The goal is to auto-generate Seccomp, AppArmor, (and potentially SELinux) profiles based on the collected information.

- AppArmor profiles
- Seccomp profiles

### CHALLENGES

Some of the advanced analysis options require a number of Linux kernel features that are not always included. The kernel you get with Docker Machine / Boot2docker is a great example of that.

## DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS

### TODO

- AppArmor profile improvements
- Better support for command line applications (e.g., ability to specify multiple executions)
- Discover HTTP endpoints to make the HTTP probe more intelligent.
- Scripting language dependency discovery in the "scanner" app.
- Explore additional dependency discovery methods.
- "Live" image create mode - to create new images from containers where users install their applications interactively.

The [`WISHLIST`](WISHLIST.md) doc includes even more potential improvements.

## ORIGINS

DockerSlim was a `Docker Global Hack Day` \#`dockerhackday` project. It barely worked at the time, but it did get a win in Seattle and it took the second place in the `Plumbing` category overall :-)

![DHD3](assets/images/dhd/docker_global_hackday3_red.png)

Since then it's been improved and it works pretty well for its core use cases. It can be better though. That's why the project needs your help! You don't need to know much about the container internals, container runtimes and you don't need to know anything about Go. You can contribute in many different ways. For example, use Slim on your images and open Github issues documenting your experience even if it worked just fine :-)
